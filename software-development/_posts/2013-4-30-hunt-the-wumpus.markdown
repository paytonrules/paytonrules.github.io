title: Game #2
---

Game #2 was actually finished in March, I've just been too lazy to post it. Shame on me. It's a very simple port of Hunt The Wumpus to the command line, and I actually did it for a training class for work. It was a good break between my JavaScript misadventure and my Unity...misadventure. I have those a lot.

Anyway it's a C# command line app, so you'll need windows to run it. I may port it to mono someday but only if I can get Fitnesse running on it. This is for a training class on that anyway. It's on the right, for March.
