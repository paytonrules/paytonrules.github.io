I owe a screenshot, as it is Saturday, but I'm currently trying to get texture packer working so that may be a moment.

Today I want to talk, briefly, about marketing. Specifically how I haven't the foggiest idea how to do it. I think it involves drinking martinis at lunch. Last week my goal was to design a marketing plan, and I didn't accomplish it, and I had the same goal this week and that never had a chance due to the day job keeping me up late for a week now. That said there are some things I know I need to do. For starters:

* Make this a site for my company
* Advertise the game on the site
* Promote the site

Those are HUGE bullet points, but the first one strikes me as a step in the right direction. Currently the only people who read this blog are folks who happen to follow me on twitter as a developer, and aren't necessarily interested in my game(s). Nothing here gives them a reason to be, so I believe the first step is to turn this page into an add for the game, with a link to this blog. Of course I'll need a domian too.

Oh that should be fun....
