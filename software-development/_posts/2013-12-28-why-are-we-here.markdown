title: Why of this blog
---

This blog sits here mostly fallow, but I am loathe to abandon it. Like many people I'd really _like_ to have a blog, but I can never seem to find the time. I've been wondering why that is, and the primary answer is that I don't have the time.

Which of course sounds like bullshit, cause it is.

I have five kids, yes. I have a busy full-time job of course. I was working to complete the one game a month competition, and didn't, but I still spend a few hours a week writing games. And of course I have some open source software too. So yes I am a pretty busy guy.

Am I busier than Jeff Atwood? Scott Hansleman? Mention your favorite technology blogger and they probably also have a bazillion things going on yet still find the time time to write. Yet I also know I'm not lazy, far from it. Indeed I'd argue that those people and others like them don't work any harder than I do. So with the new year coming what can I do to make this blog a useful place for me, and to grow a readership?

## Focus

What is this blog about? I've got sections on software-development, humor, games, and my daughter's Spanish lessons. I've written dozens of half-finished blogs on various topics that I lost interest in finishing, because there's no reason to finish in the first place. This blog lacks focus, so let's focus:

This blog is a chronicle of my independent game development. It's purpose is to share knowlege and lessons learned, and to grow an audience in the event that I have games to sell, and possibly make a little money to finance further misadventures in game dev. Don't expect much on Agile, Consulting, or Spanish except as it relates to game dev.

## Brevity

My blogs have tendency to turn into magazine articles. I picked a random article today and saw it was 500 words, and that was with a long quote. It didn't feel overly short and wasn't out of place on a blog. To that end I'm going to aim for 500 word posts. That should keep my tendency to write 4000 words, and the associated feel of wasting time writing when I should be coding, in line.

## Quick

These will be blogs. I won't spend time editing, proofreading, or adding pictures. Taking too long to write them leads to not writing them at all.

Yeah this blog is probably a New Years resolution, and it's unlikely to be interesting unless I'm very successful and people the comments useful. But it is short and quick.  Now about focus...
