Last Febuary I famously wrote "I'm shipping my January game!"

Whoops! Well not really. I wrote that blog on the train right after bundling the project and adding it to this website. I tested it locally, and it worked. Then I deployed the site....and the game didn't work. All my paths were wrong on the server. A funny thing happened at that point.

I didn't care.

I really really needed a break from Feed The Quinn and more accurately Eskimo. I started this project well over a year ago in an effort to learn about HTML5 game development. I tried extracting it from Feed The Quinn, rather than writing a framework, but I fell into the classic traps of a software developer and ended up taking months to tweak my framework - which isn't very good - and now I have a game that isn't very good. In addition I went from working on a Ruby project to a C# project to a all JavaScript all the time project.  I really really didn't feel like debugging a deploy.

So I set it aside and started work on a Unity project that will end up being my April game. That's another story.  Today I've fixed Feed The Quinn and here it is.  Allow me to to tell you about it.

**Feed The Quinn**

Feed The Quinn is a grand ambition, although I didn't think it at the time, and this is barely a prototype. As the player you are a father of a demanding child. In order to stop him from screaming you need to feed him - constantly. At the moment you start the game, move to the apples, and bring them back to the baby (Quinn). There's a lot more to what I wish the final game to be, but in this case you just bring the food back to Quinn for points.  It's pretty easy - and the link is on the right.
