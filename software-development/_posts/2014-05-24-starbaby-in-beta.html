  <p>Starbaby is a newborn god, in charge of the stars, and he's taken them all from the sky! It's not his fault, he just doesn't know any better.</p>

  <p>You have been summoned by the gods themselves to retrieve the stars before little Starbaby accidentally causes them to go supernova and destroy the universe!</p>

  <p>Starbaby has addictive gameplay and innovative controls with a retro feel. Easy to learn, hard to master, this new iPad game is fun for the whole family.</p>

The requirements are simple - an iPad with iOS 7.0 or greater installed. It doesn't work yet on the iPhone and it hasn't been tested on the Retina, so if your'e interested in being the first just let me know.</p>
