title: One Game a Month
---

I've decided to try and complete the "One Game a Month" challenge. If you're not familiar with it, you can find it here, and if your'e an aspiring independent game developer you should really consider giving it a shot. It sounds ambitious, and it is, but it's giving me the one thing I need to get something done: a deadline.

I've been "working" on a game for over a year now, and in that time I've managed to write myself a little framework for making games that I don't like very much while simultaneously producing zilch in terms of gameplay. There's multiple reasons for this, but they can all be summed up thusly:

Something else was always more pressing.

Whether it be finishing my masters, client work, or a talk at a conference something else was always jumping up the priority queue. They were always _due_.  My game is never due, so it's never done.  So first game due Jan. 31st, wish me luck.
