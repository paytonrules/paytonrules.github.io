title: Marketing Some More
---

I'm starting to form a marketing plan. Unfortunately the attempts to finish the game side-by-side with moving on marketing mean I'm doing both half-assed, except I work on this part time so it's really more like 1/8th assed. I don't have much ass, is what I'm saying.

What I have is the beginnings of a todo list. For starters I have created a signup page at [Rush Industries](http://www.rush-industries.com). I'm using launchrock.com and while I was very happy with the construction of the page, their setup is really slick, I'm not happy that I haven't been getting the signup emails and they haven't answered my tech support emails. Fortunately I only have two at the moment (well 5, but three of them are me testing it) and neither of them is a coworker or family member. They are both former coworkers. It's a start.

Beyond that I was able to get the slides from a presentation I saw at [That Conference](http://www.that-conference.com) where Jeff Weber of [Farseer Games](http://www.farseergames.com/) passed along how he turned his hobby into a profitable side business. It has several helpful tips, and how he got paid. If I can get a game or two to the level success that Krashlander has found (which is Jeff's game and is a blast). The key one being to post on Touch Arcade. I'll do that when the game is ready, which it is oooooh so close to being.

As I write this I see I only have a two steps.  I think I need a few more, so I'll do some more research this week.

Screenshot time!

I need to track down the info for proper credits. I think I'll do that now.
