title: Stand-ups are broken, but should they be fixed?
---

Recently I was working with a team of two other developers, remote from each other. I noticed that in the morning they would have a skype conversation before their stand-up, where they would discuss their issues, the status of the iteration, and divvy up the work. Then they would hang up, and immediately call their customer to have the stand-up, where they would answer the holy three questions of a stand-up. After we did this I said to the developer I told the developer that it was funny that they had a stand-up before their stand-up, and after a little back and forth over what I meant I told him "Stand-ups aren't for reporting status to the customer." He replied flabbergasted, "They're not?"

I have a little spiel I give in this situation, where I explain what stand-ups are supposed to be. I borrow heavily from [here](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) expecially the anti-pattern called "Reporting to the Leader." Then I finally end it with, "But on every team I've ever been on, if there's a customer (or scrum-master or project-manager) the meeting always turns into a status report."

## Logical Fallacies

I was thinking about his conversation the next day and it occurred to me that I was engaging in a classic ["No True Scotsman"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) logical fallacy. No REAL stand-up would be a status report to the customer therefore any stand-up that becomes one is a broken stand-up. Meanwhile nobody is actually doing working stand-ups, but if they were they'd find the value in them. What a crock. If every single stand-up becomes a status report to the customer, then stand-ups are status reports to the customer regardless of their original intent. Instead of trying to make the stand-up into this wonderful ideal I read about in a book, I should really be asking myself if daily status reports to the customer are worthwhile. 

Now things get interesting, because the most common person to miss standup is usually the very leader everybody is reporting too. After all they have more important things to attend to, which much mean it's not very important to them. Meanwhile the development team frequently gets pretty grumpy about giving updates on their status every day to the boss. So is the answer an easy no?

It depends. Despite the desire for an [On Site Customer](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OnsiteCustomer) most teams do not have their customer there all the time, even if she is physically on-site. These updates are frequently the only time of day for a customer to figure out what is going on with the team that they are supposed to be directing. In that scenario the stand-up is doing it's best to keep the customer engaged, and make them ready for questions. On other teams the customer really is around as much as the development team. Those teams hopefully have plenty of communication, big visible charts, and usable software demonstrating status that don't really need to be reported on. If a team has that kind of communication, then they don't really need a stand-up.

In either case it's probably time to accept the stand-up for what it is, rather than trying to reach some ideal written down in a book somewhere.
