<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.region-12.org/site/images/back-to-school1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://www.region-12.org/site/images/back-to-school1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>It seems like just yesterday I was writing about the start of summer, grilling, and summertime blasts. &nbsp;Well as I write this now it is September first and the older boys have started high school and are at their first Cross Country meet. &nbsp;I guess that means it's fall, and time for a new season at Language Stars!<br /><br />Hopefully you've been keeping your little one in classes all summer, and attending a summertime blast or two. &nbsp;When I was in high school myself I took for years of Spanish and I remember how the beginning of every year was review of the previous year. &nbsp;Not just a week or two either, but but about half the year. &nbsp;The knowledge simply fades away without practice. <br /><br />Of course now that I've scolded you if you didn't send your kid to Language Stars, I'll admit I'm well aware that many of you had vacations, baseball teams and other summer responsibilities that may have kept you from sending your kid(s) to foreign language class over the summer. &nbsp;So I figure I'll try send along a few tips to get your son or daughter for the new school year.<br /><br /><b>Use the homework</b><br />Language Stars teachers pass along a little sheet with all the words the children learned in the lesson that day. &nbsp;Try it out, practice. &nbsp;If you ask the teachers may be able to provide some from one the summer.<br /><br /><b>CDs</b><br />No I don't mean the "Teach yourself Spanish in the Car" CDs, unless you're trying to get the little tyke to bed. &nbsp;I mean CDs that have Spanish kids songs, that your children will enjoy. &nbsp;My 2 year old loves to just start singing "Estrellita Donde Esta" which is "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" in Spanish. &nbsp;They learn the songs without translating, and enjoy them.<br /><br /><b>Flash Cards</b><br />I like flash cards so much I wrote my own online version (which currently requires better hosting). &nbsp;These can be made into a game, which works on younger children, as well as time for bonding with your little one. &nbsp;You can even do them before bed as part of their routine.<br /><br />A gap in your child's education is hardly reason to stop learning Spanish, and while I make no claim to being an expert I do hope some of these suggestions will help you and your child succeed in bilingual education.</div>
