<div>This is a chronicle of my daughter Leilani's experiences with the <a href="http://www.languagestars.com/">Language Stars</a> program, so some backstory is probably in order.  My wife Crystina is Peruvian, a first generation* immigrant and now an American citizen.  When we met she had three children, and none of them is fluent in Spanish despite being surrounded by an entirely Spanish speaking family.  With Leilani, and eventually her little brother Quinn, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that I speak only rudimentary Spanish with a terrible accent.  Yet we would both love for our children to be bilingual.  When a friend of ours told Crystina about Language Stars we were ecstatic. </div><div><br /></div><div>We immediately signed Leilani up for the program at the Arlington Heights location, and she loves it.  Every Saturday morning she wakes up and says she wants to go to her "clase de Espa√±ol with dada."  At home we speak to her in Spanish as much as possible, with Crystina only speaking to her in it, which has helped with her dramatic progress in the language.  At this point we're looking into moving her into the 3-5 year old class, Leilani is two and a half, even though that is bittersweet for me since I won't be attending class with her anymore when we do that.  Later this week I'm gonna talk a little bit about the curriculum so far, but I think that suffices for a "Hello." </div><div><br /></div><div>* Her parents moved here too, after she did.  Does that make them second generation?  And if so, is my wife now her parents mother?  Somebody needs to look into this.</div></div>

It&#39;s great to read about your experience at Language Stars.  2 of my kids are in the Mandarin classes.  I&#39;m blogging about them, too:<br />http://teachertamseducationaladventures.blogspot.com</div>
