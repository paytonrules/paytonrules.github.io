<br /><i>Some thoughts for 2012 and Leilani's Spanish learning, which she'll need when the Mayans take over the planet.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />Like most of you I have a few resolutions for this year. &nbsp;Lose some weight, do that cool thing at work, etc. &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course as a parent I have goals for my children as well. &nbsp;Hopefully I haven't set goals for them, but set goals for what I want to do with them. &nbsp;Done right the goals will help me become a better parent to my children. &nbsp;Done wrong and I become&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Marinovich">Marv Marinovich</a>.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K-eK4qYF9y0/TwCfz2KVUWI/AAAAAAAAC58/dV6FQAepqjo/s1600/IMG_0247.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K-eK4qYF9y0/TwCfz2KVUWI/AAAAAAAAC58/dV6FQAepqjo/s320/IMG_0247.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center;">I'll be learning Spanish this year too!</td></tr></tbody></table>That said it looks like it will be a big year for both Leilani and eventually Quinn's Spanish language development. &nbsp;For Leilani it's a matter of getting her Spanish to catch up to her extraordinary English vocabulary. &nbsp;The only way for that to happen is for us to speak more Spanish around the house, and the only way for that to happen is for me to speak more Spanish. <br /><br />So it looks like I've got some studying to do.<br /><br />The problem, as such, is that I have a basic rudimentary Spanish speaking skill. &nbsp;I can ask how you are, say hello, tell you my age, and say I'm hungry. &nbsp;Whenever I try and learn more Spanish, be it via a book or even when I took continuing education classes they start with...how to say hello, to say your age, etc. &nbsp;The repetition means I speak those phrases pretty well, and nothing else, which makes it nearly impossible to speak Spanish in the house with my wife. &nbsp;She already knows my name after all. <br /><br />So that's my resolution, to start speaking Spanish in the house to my wife and daughter, then eventually my littlest son. &nbsp;Hopefully Niko (one of our older boys) won't make fun of me too much.<br /></div>
