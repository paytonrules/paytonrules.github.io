We've spent the weekend trapped inside looking at the rain, and even when it stops it's just cold and gray outside. &nbsp;So when our little ones announce they want to go to the park, it's not really an option. Fortunately we had a few things to do this weekend, such as a double-shot of Lanaguage Stars. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://activerain.com/image_store/uploads/1/5/3/9/0/ar12779528209351.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://activerain.com/image_store/uploads/1/5/3/9/0/ar12779528209351.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>Not to criticize outdoor activities, but it's nice to have someplace to take Leilani that doesn't shut down in bad weather. &nbsp;It's also great that she's taking the time to learn, rather than sitting around watching TV. &nbsp;With the winter ahead it's a good time to think of some activities we can engage in with the kids when we're all stuck indoors.<br /><br /><b>Games</b><br /><b><br /></b>Simple board games are always a fun diversion during the winter season where the entire family can get involved. With a child Leilani's age the games need to be simple, but fun that everybody wants to play. &nbsp;Toy stores tend to market games with tons of little pieces, cards and a bunch of rules. &nbsp;Children find them attractive at the store because they've got pictures of princesses or cartoon characters on them, but the best games are the classics. &nbsp;Leili is particularly partial to memory games, and look here's one in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leap-Frog-Memory-Mate-Game/dp/B000EULWLW/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350852809&amp;sr=8-15&amp;keywords=spanish+board+games">Spanish</a>.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Drawing</b><br /><b><br /></b>It's not so great for her language development, but my little girl is in love with dot-to-dot puzzles that her grandmother bought her at the moment. &nbsp;It's great for her counting and hand-eye coordination.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Stories</b><br /><b><br /></b>Leilani always likes a good book, and she also loves correcting my Spanish pronunciation. &nbsp;Longer stories can be a family activity, read together.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Get Outside When You Can</b><br /><b><br /></b>Finally when the weather starts to get bad it can be habitual to stay indoors. &nbsp;When I started this blog it was gray and dreary, but the weather has turned beautiful. &nbsp;Take advantage! &nbsp;Get outside.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Video Games</b><br /><b><br /></b>Kidding about that one.<br /><br /><i>Next Week: &nbsp;Dada needs to improve his Spanish!</i></div>
