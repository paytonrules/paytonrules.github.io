My little girl is not making it easy to write about her. &nbsp;Each Saturday I wake her up, let her know we're going to class which immediately gets her excited, then drop her off and go to Starbucks. &nbsp;She just loves it, so it's easy to wake her up a little early, but since I'm down the block I don't have much idea what she's doing.<br /><br />Or do I? &nbsp;As a parent I have to be aware of my child's education, otherwise I'm letting the school system (and Language Stars) raise my children. &nbsp;When Leili is at day care every day we ask how she behaved, although we don't usually have to ask, and the teachers raise their concerns or cover her in praise. &nbsp;The same conversation needs to take place every Language Stars class, and fortunately they are making this very easy.<br /><br />About every two weeks, there's probably a regular schedule that I haven't noticed, so I can check that today the theme is sports. &nbsp;Last week it was a birthday. &nbsp;Today's learning goal is to describe actions, using phrases like ¿Que´ estas haciendo? and Yo estoy jugando ("What are you doing?" and "I'm playing" respectively). &nbsp;At home it's difficult to get Leili to answer in Spanish, but not in the classroom. &nbsp;Since she isn't aware that the teachers speak English (it's immersion remember) she always answers back in Spanish. &nbsp;I've noticed subtle changes at home too, as she more frequently answers questions in Spanish. &nbsp;Since I've got the plan for the week I can try and use it in my own stumbling Spanish. &nbsp;In this way we re-inforce the learning. <br /><br />Language Stars is still working out very well for us, as a supplement to Leili's Peruvian mother, which is great because it gives me plenty to keep writing about. &nbsp;Once I get my coffee in &nbsp;me of course.</div>
