The Smith family just got back from a well-deserved vacation in Mackinaw City with some side trips to Mackinac Island and the UP. Yes that spelling change is correct. &nbsp;As with all bad things, the <a href="http://www.arnoldline.com/faq.htm">French</a> did it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.michigan.org/global/Media/2060/Hotel%20Iroquois.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="234" src="http://www.michigan.org/global/Media/2060/Hotel%20Iroquois.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Given that we were as far from the Spanish speaking countries as you can get while remaning in the United States, it was shocking that this was a great opportunity for both Leilani and little Quinn to practice their Spanish. &nbsp;Even their older brothers were able to get into the act, because their grandparents came along. &nbsp;Quinny is finally saying things more like sentences and is using both Spanish and English. &nbsp;Meanwhile little Leili was not only speaking Spanish to her grandparents, but doing so <i>with an accent</i>! &nbsp;Naturally she said "Yo quiero" a lot, and since the grandparents were there she got what she wanted more than she didn't. &nbsp;Especially fudge. &nbsp;There's fudge there, in case you hadn't heard.<br /><br />So here I am mentioning practice again, and I realize that I spend a lot of time talking about what Leilani does outside of Language Stars, which is a little strange since this blog is supposed to be about her time there. &nbsp;First and foremost I don't go to her class anymore, so I don't really have a lot of commentary on what she does in class other than to say she loves her teacher and it gets her moving on a Saturday morning. &nbsp;More importantly I believe that the time spent outside of class is vital to her learning inside of class, and without it she cannot have a successful bilingual education.<br /><br />Therefore you might be thinking that Language Stars hasn't been necessary for her to learn Spanish, but nothing could be further from the truth. &nbsp;Like many little ones in mixed-language families Leilani had started rejecting Spanish. &nbsp;My wife and I speak English, my in-laws try to speak English to accomodate me, and of course day care is all English. &nbsp;That means that after a time English became Leilani's "cool" language, and her vocabulary in English is still far ahead of her Spanish. &nbsp;Without the constant reinforcement of classes, including peers speaking in the language, I don't believe she'd be growing up bi-lingual. <br /><br />To sum up: &nbsp;practice, take classes, and since my French readers are&nbsp;temperamental, let me clarify that I do not believe all bad things are done by the French. &nbsp;It's likely well under 80% of them.</div>
