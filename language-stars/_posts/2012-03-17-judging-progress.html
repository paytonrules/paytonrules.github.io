Leilani speaks fantastic English for a three year old, which occasionally makes judging her progress in Spanish difficult. &nbsp;Is she behind all 3 year olds, or is her advanced English making her Spanish look bad? &nbsp;We really can't tell.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.legaljuice.com/judge.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://www.legaljuice.com/judge.jpg" width="190" /></a></div>Informally we can't help but compare her to her cousins, even though this is utter foolishness. &nbsp;We look and see that Ellie speaks better Spanish and wonder, "Gosh are we doing enough? &nbsp;Will she end up forgetting her Spanish the like the older kids did? &nbsp;Are we failures as parents? &nbsp;When will family services take the children away?"<br /><br />The moral? &nbsp;Parents are idiots.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Fortunately Language Stars has this thing they call the "Learning Ladder" which they use to gauge your child's progress against learning steps, rather than other children. &nbsp;There doesn't seem to be a copy of the specifics on the internet, but you can read about it <a href="http://www.languagestars.com/center-programs/our-approach.html#ladder">here</a>. &nbsp;There's no grades fortunately, but your child is compared to various levels on the ladder so that the teachers can respond to them appropriately. &nbsp;Even amongst a classroom I've seen the teachers treat students slightly differently, in a way that doesn't call the differences out, so that nobody is taught at too slow or too fast a pace. &nbsp;More importantly it helps me gauge my little angel's progress.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">In the last week I've noticed two things about Leilani. &nbsp;The first is that more and more she is responding to her mother and grandparents in Spanish when they speak to her. &nbsp;This is hopefully a sign that her mini-rebellion against Spanish is over. &nbsp;In addition she's using more phrases spontaneously, occasionally even speaking complex sentences. &nbsp;Looking at the Learning Ladder notes I see:</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><ul style="background-color: #fff6c1; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;"><li style="font-size: inherit; list-style-type: square; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Repeating Sentences / Using Single Words Spontaneously within the second season.</li></ul><div style="background-color: #fff6c1; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 12px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;"><strong>In their first and second year</strong>, children will develop their verbal mastery to include an increasing number of language structures, within the Spontaneous Speaking Stage:</div><ul style="background-color: #fff6c1; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;"><li style="font-size: inherit; list-style-type: square; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Using Single Words Spontaneously / Using Key Phrases Spontaneously within the first year.</li></ul><div>So it looks like "Princesa" is right on schedule. &nbsp;Perfect.</div><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
