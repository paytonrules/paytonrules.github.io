Yesterday was Leilani's first day with the kid's only class, a bittersweet moment for me. &nbsp;On the one hand, Leili is early for the class and I'm very proud that she's doing so well. &nbsp;On the other, well she doesn't need daddy to go with her anymore. &nbsp;Instead I head to the Starbucks around the corner and fiddle on the computer while she starts learning about larger sentences and concepts. &nbsp;They told me that Leilani did really well for her first day, probably because she already goes to day care and is used to being left behind.<br /><br />Since I am not actively participating in the classes, it's time to start taking a closer look at the "Big Book of FunImmersion" to help reinforce Leilani's Spanish at home. &nbsp;The book, which is given to all parents by the Language Stars staff, is essentially the textbook for your student. &nbsp;For example I am look at the "Learning Goal" page for "to be and to have" structures which is what Leilani covered this week. &nbsp;Language Stars has what they call the "learning ladder" where students progress from simple answers such as "Si" or "No" and move up to the child asking questions themselves. &nbsp;Right now Leili is capable of answers like "Ella tiene pelo rubio." &nbsp;which means that "She has blond hair." &nbsp;provided she is given a little prompting. &nbsp;At the next level she would be asked "¿Cómo es ella?" and she would give a more articulate description. &nbsp;Around the house Leilani&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;does give larger descriptions in Spanish, but generally she uses English, although that could be so I understand.<br /><br />In addition to that, I think I'm going to start listening to Spanish language CDs. &nbsp;I bought some a long time ago, when I first started dating my wife, and used to listen to them while running. &nbsp;This led to some weird scenarios where I'd pass people saying, "Que es esto" and getting weird looks. &nbsp;In addition I also took continuing education classes at a local junior college. &nbsp;In spite of that I sill only speak enough Spanish to get made fun of, and I'd really like to be able to understand my daughter when she's sixteen and telling me she hates me in Spanish. &nbsp;To that end for her benefit, and mine, I'm going to try and keep up. &nbsp;At least a little bit. &nbsp;I have an hour and a half at Starbucks now, after all.</div>
