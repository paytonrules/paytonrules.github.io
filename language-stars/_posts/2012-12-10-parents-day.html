It was Parents Day at Language Stars, and since Crysti's never been I suggested she take Leilani instead of me. &nbsp;As is typical of her, she managed to get the names of a few parents (which I haven't done in two plus years) and get Leili invited to a birthday party.<br /><br />There's a reason she's called my better half.<br /><br />Anyway as is customary we got a progress report on our little one, and I'm happy to report she's doing quite well. &nbsp;It's not as if she get's A's and B's of course, but at this time she is "Doing Easily" almost everything that in her current Learning Phase. &nbsp;That's repeating full sentences &amp; questions while using single words&nbsp;spontaneously. &nbsp;The only thing she's working on is repeating first person sentences with only one prompt. &nbsp;If I know my girl, I suspect she insists on saying what she wants in the language she wants. &nbsp;She's occasionally strong willed.<br /><br />Indeed we even have examples of what she's been saying in class:<br /><br />Teacher: "¡Y este perro es grande!"<br />Leilani: "Noo, es chiquito."<br />Teacher: "Oh, si es chiquito."<br /><br />There's also a section here about her papá being named Erick which would be great if my name had a k at the end of it, but I suppose it's not a class on spelling in English. <br /><br />Why does any of this matter? &nbsp;I think it's important that the lessons are more than just glorified babysitting. &nbsp;If you've ever sent kids to swimming lessons, summer camp or karate you know a lot of parents are just looking for an hour to spare for themselves, and it shows in the results they get out of them. &nbsp;With Language Stars, a true class, she's making real progress we can track.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
