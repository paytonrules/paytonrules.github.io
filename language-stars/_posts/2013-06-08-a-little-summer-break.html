This morning Leili and I went through a normal routine of getting ready for Clasé de Español. We were a little early so Leili was watching Sofia the first with mom while I fiddled with my ever-present laptop.<br /><br />As a rule this is a terrible habit of mine, but I checked my email. Usually this means I get bad news (it's how I ended up working last labor day) but this time it saved us some serious trouble. There's no class today! &nbsp;It's the break between the Spring and Summer quarters, which makes for a great time to recap a little where Leili is at with her lessons.<br /><br />Last time I blogged I about how much Leili wants to do her homework. I'm not grading these assignments of course, but Leili continues to do them on the weekend. She dutifully takes them back to show Miss Carmen, who gives her encouragement and corrections.</div>
