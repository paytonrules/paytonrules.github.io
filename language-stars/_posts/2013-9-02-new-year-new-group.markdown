title: New Year New Group
---

It's a new year! Well a new school year anyway both for our older boys, who return to college and high school respecitvely, and for Leilani at Language Stars. This school year she'll be in a new group too!

Leili's normal group goes on Saturdays at 9 in the morning, and that worked reasonably well for us. Provided we were out the door by 8:20 we had time to stop at Dunkin' Donuts for my coffee and Leili's bagel. Leilani has a habit of taking any one time activity and turning it into a tradition, and that's how bagels became mandatory. Until I bought her a donut one day. Now we do one week donut, one week bagel, one week donut, etc. I'm not sure if this would have been a bagel week, but we had the week off in prep for the new year.

Anyway next week will mean a new class room, with older students, and a new class time with a later in the day time. This will mean new challenges for my little girl, but fortunately she's been preparing for stepping up a level for a while now. Since she's been doing make ups recently she's already been taking the class with the older group, and Miss Carmen (her teacher) is certain she's ready for the older students. Hopefully this will mean she'll use more sentences, and possbily get more confident in front of her Spanish family.

Her getting older puts more pressure on me to work on my Flashcards app. I haven't touched it since That Conference, as my one week break has extended to three weeks while I finish up another project, and time flies. Soon she'll be too old to benefit from that game, and I need my captive audience of two (her and her brother) so I better get it done. To that end I'm planning a demo to you (my audience) for the beginning of next month.

Until then.
