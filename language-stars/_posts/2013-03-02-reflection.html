It's been about 2 years of Leilani at language stars, so it's a little past time to reflect on what she's learned and how it's helped her Spanish in our bi-lingual family. &nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>For those of you that don't want to read my entire blog, jerks, I'll summarize. &nbsp;For about two years, maybe longer, we've been taking my daughter to Language Stars to supplement her Spanish learning. &nbsp;When I say supplement it's because my wife is from Peru and speaks to her in Spanish at home. &nbsp;As hard as they work at Language Stars there's no doubt in my mind her home learning is far more effective than anything they can do.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
