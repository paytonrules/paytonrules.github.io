<a href="http://minnlawyer.com/minnlawyerblog/files/2010/08/overworked.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://minnlawyer.com/minnlawyerblog/files/2010/08/overworked.jpeg" width="320" /></a>This blog has gotten a little fallow of late, with my updates slowing. &nbsp;Clearly there's only one reasonable explanation.<br /><br />My daughter has gotten stupider.<br /><br />Okay maybe that's not true. &nbsp;It's entirely possible that I just went through a really busy and difficult project at work, am finishing up my Masters degree, and my wife and I have had so many weekend activities that Leili has been pretty regularly having make-up classes at Language Stars.<br /><br />Yeah or my daughter's a dummy, I'll let you decide.<br /><br />Leilani starts her class with a new teacher today. &nbsp;Clarissa, her previous teacher, is leaving for greener pastures. &nbsp;Of course the adults are happy for her, but last night Leilani was traumatized. &nbsp;I couldn't get her to sleep as she cried, "But I HAVE to go to class with Clarissa." This isn't the first time this has happened.<br /><br />When Leilani was still in the parents-and-tots class her teacher, Diego, had to abruptly return to Columbia for family reasons. &nbsp;This traumatized her, as Diego was legitimately great, and I don't think she spoke much in her first class with Carlos. I don't mind admitting this was a little concerning for my wife and I, as we were worried that maybe Leilani didn't so much embrace the institution as she did the particular teacher. &nbsp;What if she never enjoyed class again? &nbsp;Did we waste our tuition?<br /><br />It was ill-founded. &nbsp;Within a week Carlos was getting regular hugs from my daughter and she was just as excited to come to class as ever. &nbsp;When Leilani moved to kids only she was reluctant to go with Clarissa, and last night I had to calm to down her crying fit. &nbsp;I have no doubt the next teacher will be just as great.</div>
