title: Does that make me craaaaazayyy

It's been a crazy week, even by Smith family standards. It began last Sunday with a trip up to the Kalahari Resort in Wisconsin Dells. I was a speaker at [That Conference](http://www.thatconference.com) in the resort and was able to take the family with me. All the kids had a great time taking advantage of the indoor and outdoor water parks, and Leilani loved sleeping in the sofa-bed. Daddy did not.

That ended Tuesday and would have been enough excitement but instead of coming home we came straight to my in-laws. We're getting hardwood floors installed and it's taking longer than we thought. It's wonderful of my wife's parents to host us but I miss my own bed. I think Leilani thinks we're camping and is loving sleeping on the floor. Much like the sofa-bed, I'm not. Crysti offered to take turns but she's got a cold and I don't think the floor would help.

Despite the upheaval we made it to Language Stars both Saturdays, where Leili's been a bit - let's say rambunctious. Two Saturdays ago she did a make-up class, so two classes in a row, and between classes she laid herself down in front of the door and said nobody can leave. I'm glad she's making friends, but that's hardly appropriate. Meanwhile this week she only had one class, and wouldn't leave when I came to pick her up. She screamed and cried and I had to pull her over my shoulder to get her out of there. I feel like this might need to be a new slogan for Language Stars: So great your kid won't leave.

Her homework, which she usually does quite well, continues to provide inspiration for the Flashcards game. This week the homework involves finding "Scott's" ball, and then picking a ball amongst several. So you say (in Spanish) "The ball has stripes. Which ball is Scott's?" It's a little frightening from a developer perspective. My biggest failing tends to be making games that are overly complicated and/or require a lot of content. For contrast I saw an independent game developer speak at That Conference whose game requires some physics programming, one character, and then very simple levels. Even though the levels are simple, he still struggles with getting as many out as he likes.

Flashcards is a simple game, very easy to program, but could potentially require a ton of content. I'm actually taking a brief break from the game right now, preparing for the talk required a lot of work, so I'm not expecting another update until my next blog post, but I'm hoping to have the framework for lessons ready in about a month. Then it's time to make them, and if I add programming time I'll never get around to making lessons. That said the homework this week really lends itself to my game, so I'll have to think about it.

Those changes are why you might notice a different look and feel to the site today. You see Walter and Teresa (my in-laws) don't have internet, which gave me just the excuse I needed to get off of blogger. It's a nice platform, but it doesn't really let me write without internet, and I'm a computer programmer I shouldn't need that stuff anyway. It gives me a chance to update the look and feel, which is pretty dated. Expect to see more changes now that I have the freedom of hosing my own site.

Sorry for the rambling post, but it's my blog, my rules.
