"<i>I did jump rope three times and then I fell on my butt."</i><br /><br /><a href="http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/jump-rope-relay.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="280" src="http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/jump-rope-relay.jpg" width="320" /></a>Last week we finally got Leilani into an extra class for one of her many make-ups. &nbsp;Because of scheduling she was in the 5-8 year old class, which must have made her a pretty short student. &nbsp;Fortunately she did extremely well, and spoke more Spanish because of the advanced nature of the class.<br /><br />Interestingly, for those of you out there with older children, Miss Clarissa's concern was that Leilani might have some trouble with the more "active" nature of the class. &nbsp;Apparently they did some jump rope, so when I arrived to pick my little angle up the first thing she told me was how she fell doing jump rope. &nbsp;I guess the big kids were nice about it, and had a hearty laugh.<br /><br />The 5-8 year olds appear to have the same&nbsp;curriculum&nbsp;as the 3-5, at least based on the language stars website, but they have progressed farther up the "Learning Ladder" leading to longer and more thoughtful sentences and interactions, and play more complicated and occasionally competitive games like bean bag toss and of course jump rope. &nbsp;I suspect this system allows older children to join Language Stars at any time, while still allowing children who have been with the program for some time to advance in their learning. <br /><br />So if you have a 7 year old, it's not to late for them to get started, and they probably won't fall on their butt.</div>
