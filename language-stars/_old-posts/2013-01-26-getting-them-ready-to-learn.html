<br />I've written in the past about the times that Leilani is so excited for class that I can't get her to leave. &nbsp;Well last Saturday was not one of those days. Leilani started crying halfway to class, because she didn't want to go today. In addition she was traumatized because I forgot her gloves. &nbsp;It got me to thinking, how can we make sure our kids are prepared when we take them to school.<br /><br /><b>Good Night's Sleep</b><br /><b><br /></b>This one is obvious but class was on a Saturday and I was a little lax about getting Leilani into bed at a reasonable time the night before. &nbsp;Well when she's tired she's grumpy, and she moves slow so we start running late. &nbsp;Nobody ends up happy.<br /><br /><b>Talk about the class on the way</b><br /><b><br /></b>Leili has always had a habit of answering Spanish questions in English, and as a consequence she listens to Spanish better than she speaks it. &nbsp;So on our way to class we talk about the project she'll do and I reinforce the point with questions like, "Are you go gonna be a good girl and speak lots of Spanish today?" &nbsp;Then when I pick her up she almost always tells me, "I was a good girl!"<br /><br /><b>What did you learn today?</b><br /><b><br /></b>My wife and I both ask this question when class is over. &nbsp;I do it in the car and then Crystina asks again at home. &nbsp;It's a great way to reinforce the knowledge, so it's not forgotten in a weekend full of games, toys and TV.<br /><br /><b>Let's look at your project/homework</b><br /><b><br /></b>Language Stars classes always have a "projecto" and some homework. &nbsp;It's easy to look at the project, because Leilani is excited about it and wants to show us. &nbsp;It's a little harder to get her to sit down and look at the practice, but so far she's young enough that she's still excited for homework so it's not that hard. &nbsp;Both of these help reinforce what she's been learning.<br /><br />All of this probably takes a half-hour at most. &nbsp;In fact much of it is just ordinary conversation, but they are extremely beneficial in terms of getting your little one to get the most out of any classes.</div>
