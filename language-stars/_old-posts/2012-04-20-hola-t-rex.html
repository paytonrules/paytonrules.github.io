<br /><div class="p1">I'm a little behind writing lately and I apologize for that.&nbsp; I'd like to blame a busy work schedule or Leili's potty training but the truth is last weekend I just plain forgot to do some writing.&nbsp; I like to think my audience forgot to read as well, so we're even. &nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I suppose that means I should make this blog extra looooooooong, to better to bore you with, but I don't think I'm gonna do that either.&nbsp; Instead I'm gonna talk about the largest animals ever to walk the earth. &nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Dinosaurs!&nbsp; Spanish speaking Dinosaurs!</div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.book530.com/paintingpic/gallery0012/brontosaurus-breakfast.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://www.book530.com/paintingpic/gallery0012/brontosaurus-breakfast.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Como Estas Brontosaurus</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Okay to my knowledge Dinosaurs do not speak Spanish, but they do seem to be a source of amusement for my little girl.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure every child goes through a phase where they decide that&nbsp; dinosaurs are the greatest thing ever,probably because they are big enough to eat Mom and Dad.&nbsp; It seems both her day care (Montessori) and Language Stars have figured this out as both institutions have taken some time to use the large reptiles in their teaching.&nbsp; That's not to say that Leili is learning the vocabulary, although she is, but that they are using a child's natural interests to help drive the teaching of more useful speaking.&nbsp; After all saying "Tyrannosaurus" in Spanish may not be useful, but saying "The Brontosaurus is taller than the Tyrannosaurus" is.&nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">What this demonstrates to me is that all of Leili's teachers take reaching students very seriously.&nbsp; I'm currently a Masters student, and many a professor could care less if you learn or not.&nbsp; This is their prerogative and I'm an adult, but children aren't the same way.&nbsp; Every Saturday Leilani needs to want to go to class, and she needs to feel like she's playing when she's learning.&nbsp; If she's "playing" then she's paying attention, and the message will stick.&nbsp; If she's associating words like bigger or shorter with one of her favorite things she's far more likely to remember.&nbsp; This is far more effective than wrote memorization or repeating phrases that don't really interest her, such as "please" and "thank you."</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Now hopefully this means they'll have the next classes about being an astronaut, or better yet a combination astronaut-princess.&nbsp; That would really help.</div></div>
