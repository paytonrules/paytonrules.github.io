<br />What's the ultimate test of whether or not your child is enjoying their learning experience? &nbsp;Is it &nbsp;how well they speak the language? &nbsp;Their excitement when it's time to go to class? &nbsp;How well they do on a test?<br /><br />All those things are probably important, but to me the simplest way to tell if your child is being challenged is how they leave. &nbsp;When you pick up your child from any class, be it language or swimming or sumo wrestling class, are they eager to leave? &nbsp;Do they tell you about what they did? &nbsp;Do they talk about their teachers? &nbsp;Or do they just start asking for candy?<br /><br />I think I'll stop asking questions now and start telling you a little about what happens when I pick up Leilani. &nbsp;The first thing she almost always says is, "I don't want to leave!" &nbsp;She wanted to keep drawing "el flor" on the whiteboard and talking to her friends. &nbsp;Now of course any child will want to keep playing when given the choice between that and riding in the car, but in her case it's informative because when I pick her up she's not playing, she's <i>learning. &nbsp;</i>This isn't the same as when I pick her up from day care and she's riding a tricycle, which she wants to keep riding. &nbsp;On other days, when she's not playing outside, she's desperate to come home. &nbsp;That's not a knock on her day care, which has to entertain and inform her three days a week for 8+ hours a day, but it demonstrates the difference between it and her Language Stars classes. <br /><br />See Leilani almost never wants to leave Language Stars. &nbsp;When I leave her to make up a class and she stays for two, she is never eager to go. &nbsp;Sometimes she asks to go on Sundays ( when they are closed ) and most of the time she greets her teacher with a hug. &nbsp;Beyond that she shows me her project, tells me the words they learned, and about her friends in class. &nbsp;Usually this is all unprompted. &nbsp;Having her excitedly explain how class went is one of the highlights of my day.<br /><br />In other news I'm on a train to St. Louis right now for a conference, which I got on shortly after her class. &nbsp;She cried hysterically when I left, it was horrible, and I miss my little girl pretty badly right now. Hopefully she's having fun playing with some toys at home and maybe learning some Spanish with mommy.</div>
