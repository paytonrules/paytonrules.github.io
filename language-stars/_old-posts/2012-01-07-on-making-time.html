<a href="http://lovingthebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Super-Dad.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="http://lovingthebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Super-Dad.jpg" width="320" /></a>Upon re-reading this blog it's&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me that I make myself sound like some kind of super-dad who spends hours up hours working on his daughter's Spanish. &nbsp;This is completely true. &nbsp;Thanks to my super powers I am able to extend the day to 50 hours without any sign of fatigue, using the first 24 hours for a normal day the next 18 for studying Spanish and then getting a healthy 8 hours of sleep. &nbsp;This is why my three year old daughter is able to read Don Quixote.<br /><br />In the real world I have two little secrets:<br /><br /><ul><li>This is my blog, and as such I only write the good things. &nbsp;When I don't practice Spanish with my daughter for a month I don't put it here.</li><li>I try to schedule a lot of my time.</li></ul>The first is self-evident but the second is more important. &nbsp;Scheduling time with your daughter sounds awful I know, but my schedule seems to grow increasingly hectic with each passing year so if I don't set aside times then I often see goals and deadlines fly by. &nbsp;A few examples:<br /><br /><ul><li>With Leilani in a kids-only class I use her classroom time for this blog.</li><li>I make an effort to read to her before bed a couple times a week, and make at least one of the books Spanish.</li></ul><div>When I talked about learning Spanish myself, that's in the car on my commute. &nbsp;None of this requires a huge investment of time, but you do have to make some time for it. &nbsp;I don't have a calendar or anything, but I do know when I haven't read her a Spanish book all week and when she's in class and I'm not writing this little guilt angel appears on my shoulder.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The point of this little note is just that I am not a super-dad, and you don't have to be a super-dad or super-mom to help your children learn a new language. &nbsp;Just a little practice and encouragement and a lot of help from a&nbsp;language&nbsp;academy can go a long way.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also recommend marrying a native Spanish Speaker, an option that may not be available to you.&nbsp;</div><br /><br /></div>
