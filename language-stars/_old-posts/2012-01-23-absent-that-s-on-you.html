What I've talked about before, <a href="http://languagestars.blogspot.com/2011/11/giving-thanks-for-family-language-and.html">practice practice practice</a>, becomes more important when there is extended time between classes. &nbsp;While the make-ups are great Language Stars does not have a time-machine on site and the longer the time between classes the more your child will forget. &nbsp;Check your&nbsp;curriculum&nbsp;<i>before</i>&nbsp;you're going to miss a class or two, and practice as much as you can. &nbsp;Then get back to class!</div></div>
