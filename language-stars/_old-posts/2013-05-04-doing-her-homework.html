Language Stars has always given out activity sheets each week after class, and while sometimes I would have Leili try to do them with her mother, they tended to pile up in the backseat of the car.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pkwy.k12.mo.us/southsr/parkwaysouth/pages/parent/A-Plus/A-logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.pkwy.k12.mo.us/southsr/parkwaysouth/pages/parent/A-Plus/A-logo.jpg" /></a>Until a few weeks ago that is.<br /><br />For some reason Leilani decided on her own that she needed to do her "Spanish Homework." She took the sheet into her older brothers' room and did her homework while they did theirs. This is probably annoying, and Leilani is only learning to read, but she's the only girl amongst 4 boys and they dote on her.<br /><br />This was exceptionally cute, but now we had a problem. While Leilani might be brilliant, in my unbiased opinion, I don't know the four year old that can hang on to their homework for an entire week without losing track of it, and that's what happened today. Leili frantically ran around the house looking for her homework, which is of course not due or graded, until we finally found a sheet she didn't have.<br /><br />In true Smith family tradition she did her new homework on the back of a book on the way to school. She giddily showed it to her teacher Miss Carmen, who praised her work and showed her any mistakes. I am certain she'll be doing her home work again.</div>
