She's still not speaking enough Spanish in the house, but she has no trouble understanding virtually anything her mother or grandparents say. &nbsp;She's doing quite well in the 3-5 year old class and has little trouble when in the 5-8 year old class. Her last progress ladder got rave reviews, and I'm happy.<br /><br />So it's on to 2013 time to make goals. &nbsp;What do we have to look forward to in the new year?<br /><br />First and foremost it's probably time for the Mighty Quinn to start with the parents and tots class. &nbsp;Quinny is 2 and a half, which is older than Leilani was when she started, but Quinn hasn't been as verbal as Leilani was. &nbsp;It's pretty common for girls to develop faster than boys, and in the past Quinn probably would have been wasting time in the class. &nbsp;Now he's ready.<br /><br />I've also written a lot about learning more Spanish myself, but haven't done a lot about it. &nbsp;If I want a truly bi-lingual family I'm going to need to make the commitment. &nbsp;We can expect that to happen in the coming weeks. <br /><br />Finally Leilani will move up to the older kids class full time at some point this year, probably sooner than later. &nbsp;I'm looking forward to see bigger advances with a more difficult class.<br /><br />That's all for 2012, bring on 2013!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div>
