Today is going to be a huge day, and mean a lot of time for me in the coffee shop.  Leilani's schedule looks like this:<br /><br /><ul><li>9:00 Class</li><li>10:30 Make up class (finally all caught up!)</li><li>1:30 Princess Blast!</li></ul><div>She's particularly excited about the Princess Blast, which I wrote about two weeks ago, and was already trying on her princess outfit this morning. &nbsp;She also always enjoys the make up classes with the older children, so I fully expect she's gonna have a great day. &nbsp;Meanwhile I'll sit here and write. &nbsp;Well it's a nice coffee shop.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the Princess Blast Leilani gets to wear her princess outfit of course, and spent the entire drive over choosing out which tiara wanted. &nbsp;She's gonna go with the "Hello Kitty" one. &nbsp;She's already used to being called "Princessa" around the house but today I hope she learns a few more words. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Queen - </b>La Reina</div><div><b>King - </b>El Ray (will also accept "Dada")</div><div><b>Dress - </b>El Vesitdo</div><div><b>Crown - </b>La Corona</div><div><b>Tiara - </b>La Tiara</div><div><br /></div><div>That's just a few but considering how much my little girl loves being a princess I think it will be beneficial to make the weekend revolve around describing herself in Spanish. &nbsp;I'm sure I've written this before, but when the little one thinks you're playing a game she's much more likely to practice, and practice makes perfect (even for Princesas!).</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
