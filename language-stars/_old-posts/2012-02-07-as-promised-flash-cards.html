Tl;Dr As promised two weeks ago a JavaScript Flash Cards game for practicing Spanish:<br /><br /><canvas id="canvas" height="200" width="350">Your Browser does not support the game, sorry.</canvas><br /> <p>To play simply start typing the English translation for the word above.  If you get it right you'll see CORRECT and it will advance to the next word or phrase, there's about 40 right now plucked from the current weeks lessons on the Language Stars website.  If you don't see any game above it's because your browser doesn't support it.  I've tested it in Chrome, and I expect it would work fine in Safari or Firefox, but not IE.  If you're an IE user I'm not sure how you use the web anyway.</p> <p>There are a few things to note when playing the game.  The first is that the translations don't leave much room for error.  If something says "Lo Perro" and you type "Dog" it won't be correct.  You need to say "The Dog".  Also anything that could be "I am" has been abbreviated to "I'm".  This game is also largely a proof of concept, using a bigger project I've been working on for a while now.  As such it will probably change in the future, as I add more features, so come back from time to time.</p> <p>Finally contact me if you see any mistakes.  In some cases I pulled the phrases out of songs and nursery rhymes, and out of context the translation may no longer be correct.  If you're technically minded it is possible to use some JavaScript debugging tools to cheat, but remember cheaters never win.  They only get better grades.</p> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31507720/flashCardsBrowserified.js"></script></div>
