Last week I didn't write my blog during Leili's class like usual, because it was Parent's Day at Language Stars. &nbsp;On Parent's Day we parents get to join in the class, participating and seeing our child's progress. &nbsp;The kids love this so enjoy these years now. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure Leilani won't want to sit on the flor with me and point to pictures of elephants when she's fifteen. &nbsp;At that point she'll want me to drop her off three blocks from the school so her friends can't see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adewale_oshineye/5141455843/in/set-72157625176673859">the Dr. Who stickers on my laptop</a>.<br /><br />Observing the class up close I couldn't help but compare it to my high school and college experiences in foreign language classes. &nbsp;The children were given an exercise where animals were missing a feature. &nbsp;The elephant was missing it's feet, a zebra its stripes, a girafe it's spots, etc. &nbsp;The children had to answer questions using the verb tener saying something like the following:<br /><br />"Elefanté no tiene pies!" <br /><br />Of course I'm going from memory and probably getting it wrong, which is kind of my point. &nbsp;You see I can conjugate tener (to have) in my sleep:<br /><br /><table><tbody><tr><td>Yo tengo</td></tr><tr><td>Tú tienes</td></tr><tr><td>Él tiene</td></tr><tr><td>Nosotros tenemos</td></tr><tr><td>Ellos Tienen</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>But I can't seem to use it in a sentence unless it's a sentence I practiced like "Yo Tengo Hambre" (I am hungry). &nbsp;When you learn Spanish at the higher levels an enormous amount of time is spent learning conjugations, repeating them over and over. &nbsp;That makes a certain amount of sense, you only learn a language through repetition, but it's often done at the expense of conversation. &nbsp;In the event I do formulate a sentence it is so formal that any Spanish speaker immediately switches to English for my benefit. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The children on the other hand have no idea what tense they are using tener in. &nbsp;They only know they are talking about elephants and girafes, which is the same way they learn their native tongue. &nbsp;It's tempting to say that won't work with adults, but with so many different immersion classes popping up I'm not willing to dismiss the idea. &nbsp;Indeed the Barron's course I bought quite some time ago says that virtually the only way to become fluent and sound right is to repeat native speakers, and doesn't spend much time on conjugations. &nbsp; Seems like something might be worth another try.</div></div>
