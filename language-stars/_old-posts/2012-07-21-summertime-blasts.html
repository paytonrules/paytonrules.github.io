<P>Here we are in the heart of summer "enjoying" one of the hottest and driest summers on record. In between vacations and watching my grass die, Leilani has been catching up on some lost classes as I documented last week. &nbsp;Naturally the week after that she missed a class again, so she's catching up again today.</p> <div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://toonbarn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dora-saves-the-snow-princess.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://toonbarn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dora-saves-the-snow-princess.jpg" width="320" /></a></div> <span>In addition to grass death, summer also means cool foreign language blasts. &nbsp;These are 3 hour classes with a theme that children love, almost a foreign language party. &nbsp;</span> <span>The children play new games and activities, some outside, and&nbsp;</span> <span>Leilani will probably attend the Disney Princess one. She has all the movies and a bed made up of princesses after all. &nbsp;Of course she also loves Diego and Dora, which is another language blast, so maybe we'll send her to both.</span> <br /><br /><span>You could probably make an argument that language blasts are frivolous, and that regular attendance at the normal classes is probably the best way for the child to keep learning. &nbsp;This is probably true, but regular attendance his <i>hard </i>if your child loses interest. &nbsp;Even the most patient child will eventually decide they don't want to go to class anymore, that they'd rather play toys at home or watch TV. &nbsp;Regularly changing things up is one of the great ways to keep your child progressing.</span><br /></div>
