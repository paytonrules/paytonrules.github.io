Thanksgiving has come and gone, and with it a full week of Language Stars. &nbsp;The hard working teachers get vacation too, and the weekend before that Leilani had a sleepover at her grandparents. &nbsp;This meant two Saturdays in a row without her weekly jolt of Spanish class to keep her progressing. &nbsp;Since I'm sure you have similar issues, let me tell you some of the ways we made sure Leilani practiced her Spanish without going to class.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://dlewis.net/nik-archives/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/turkey1-300x234.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://dlewis.net/nik-archives/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/turkey1-300x234.jpg" /></a></div>Of course with our family it's easier, we simply re-emphasized speaking in Spanish to Crystina's parents. &nbsp;Since it was the holiday weekend we visited anyway, so this much was simple. &nbsp;Since you may not have your own Spanish speaking in-laws, and suggesting you remarry is impractical, I'd say just talk as much as you can in the language your child is learning. &nbsp;This means you'll have to learn a little of it too. &nbsp;Such is parenting.<br /><br />Beyond that Crystina started playing Christmas songs in the car. &nbsp;Even though Christmas songs should not be played in the car before Thanksgiving I allowed it because she played Spanish Christmas songs. &nbsp;Music is one of the best ways to prod a memory, be it a child's or yours, as shown by the scientific demonstration below.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/-F_tT-q8EF0/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-F_tT-q8EF0&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-F_tT-q8EF0&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div>Leiliani's friend Domenica came over, and interestingly enough she sometimes insists that Leili speak in Spanish. &nbsp;She then turns around and insists her mother, who is Peruvian like my wife, speak in English. &nbsp;Go figure. &nbsp;They also wanted to watch a movie so we started watching Toy Story 3, but we turned the language to Spanish. &nbsp;Tom Hanks has a lovely accent by the way.<br /><br />The point of this mini-post is that while Language Stars may take breaks, you don't have to. &nbsp;Just remember to keep finding ways to practice.<br /><br />Of course you stopped reading this because you can't stop singing about how Albania borders on the Adriatic.</div>
