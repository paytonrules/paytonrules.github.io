Leili spent about two weeks doing animals in Spanish class, which may not have been very useful for her. &nbsp;Since she was a little more than one year old we've been reading books before bed, and one of her favorites was a simple book called "Animales." &nbsp;Dozens of pictures of conejos (rabbits), osos (bears) and of course dinosaurios. &nbsp;There was no story, and when she was younger she was less opposed to me reading in Spanish, so this amounted to a vocabulary lesson at regular intervals. &nbsp;I know I've mentioned practice before, and this was a great way to make practice fun. &nbsp;She doesn't read that book anymore, at nearly three she wants more story, but this put her ahead of the game at a very young age.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3rEzQO0rWmo/TpmaPbq74iI/AAAAAAAAC5M/VfPnB6swzNQ/s1600/IMG_4820.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3rEzQO0rWmo/TpmaPbq74iI/AAAAAAAAC5M/VfPnB6swzNQ/s320/IMG_4820.jpg" width="240" /></a></div>This has me thinking about my youngest son Quinn and when he should start at Language Stars. &nbsp;His verbal skills seem to be behind Leili's at a similar age, he's just past one, and he's definitely not ready yet. &nbsp;Part of the reason we ended up taking these classes was that Leili spoke so much English that we were concerned her Spanish would never keep up. &nbsp;That said I suspect at any moment he'll start saying more than "mama" and "dada" and move on to more important phrases like "Go Bears" and "Boo Packers."<br /><br />What does this mean? &nbsp;Well we're not gonna rush Quinn into language stars and make him sit on my lap while the other little ones can properly participate. &nbsp;Every child is different and you know yours better than I do, but more than a few kids that were brought into the Language Stars parents and tots class couldn't say their own name and I don't see how you can possibly get your money's worth at that point.<br /><br />Now what it means is that Crystina and my nights are about to get more hectic. &nbsp;It's time for one of us to start reading to Quinn while the other puts to bed the increasingly difficult Leilani. &nbsp;Both English and Spanish books should help give him the same head start that Leilani had, and maybe when he goes to class he'll know what a perro is too. &nbsp;(It's a dog).</div>
