# Why? #

If you're reading this you probably already know who I am.  You probably read my [occasional postings](http://blog.8thlight.com/eric) at the 8th Light blog or follow me on twitter at @paytonrules.  Maybe you followed my [mentoring blog](http://myfirstapprentice.tumblr.com) and are waiting with baited breath for my final post there.  If so then you probably either work for 8th Light, or are aware of me because I work for 8th Light.  There's certainly nothing wrong with that  as 8th Light is a great company, worthy of your attention, and I am honored to work there as a Software Craftsman.

However, and here's the answer to the question, you didn't come to this blog because of me.  Wipe 8th Light off my resume and my online presence amounts to a github page with very little of note on it, and really that needs to change.  I don't pay attention to the developers I admire, the ones I follow on twitter or who's blogs are in my RSS reader, because of where they work.  I do so because they consistently say and do things I find admirable or notable, and in order to have the kind of career I aim to have then I can't just be a guy who works for a great company.  I need to be a noted software developer, who also happens to work for a great company. 

Hopefully I say or do something on this site that makes it worth staying a while.
