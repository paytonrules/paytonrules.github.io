For my 


* Getting things under test
  - Note your solution
  - The options that others use, and why they are foolish

* Rebuilding the solution each time
* Got it under git, kinda
* Why the hell is the proj binary?  Still no git?
* Getting blender objects in
* Three objects in, in no time fast
* MonoDevelop kinda sucks
