_This is my first blog that has nothing to do with development or games. It probably sucks. Read at your own risk._

"When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say is I'm a Skynyrd fan."

There's been a whole lot of ink spilled on this awful, awful, awful song and on the line above in particular. If we take the lyrics at their word, Brad Paisley was completely unaware of the symbolism of the Confederate flag, and was shocked by the reaction when he wore it at a Starbucks. Never mind how implausible it is that anybody would notice, or how ridiculous it is that a very very very rich white man in the South apparently feels persecuted. Let's ignore the fact that if Brad is truly unaware of what the Confederate battle flag represents then he is so incredibly stupid he requires 24/7 supervision, lest he accidentally drink paint thinner or stick his dick in the light socket. Let's ignore all that and take Mr. Paisley, or the character in his song, at his word. This was an accident and he didn't know.

Put yourself in his shoes. Imagine a different situation. Right now I'm wearing a Chicago Code Camp T-Shirt that has a CCC on it. Let's say I head to Starbucks and the guy behind the counter informs me that the CCC on the front stands for a hate group. One with hundreds of years of history behind it. That it's disgusting, and I didn't know. What's the proper reaction?  Is it:

1. Apologize profusely and never wear the shirt again.
2. Woe is me! Political Correctness run amok!  I'll write a song with LL Cool J where I somehow make a black man apologize for the civil war.

Hint, it's not 1.


## Political Correctness

This song is from a tradition of white men whining about political correctness. Somewhere, sometimes, people have a point. In my profession we have an issue where women are underrepresented dramatically. Occasionally this will blow up at an event where a man does something stupid, upsets a woman, and overreaction commences. In some of these cases the problem could have been resolved by the woman confronting the man immediately, as they might very well have gotten a quick apology.

Sometimes they have a point, but frequently somebody gives a presentation called ["Perform Like a Pr0n Star"](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/) at a conference that has 200 men and 6 women. This is the kind of thing that the people who complain about "political correctness" don't get. Context matters, and maybe that joke talk would have gone over fine if the conference was half men and half women. Of course it probably wouldn't have, because then it wouldn't have been funny.

Back to our song, poor Brad Paisley. He can't wear his Skynard shirt without getting a dirty look. Of course the man behind the counter, who I assume is black or your song is pointless, he can't walk into _any store in town_ without getting a dirty look just because of the color of his skin. His parents had to use different water fountains and schools, and sit in the back of the damn bus just cause he has the nerve to have more melanin than you do. Statistically his schools were most likely far inferior to yours growing up, which might be why he works at that Starbucks.

Hey Brad, how many Black country singers are there anyway? LL Cool J doesn't count.

Now I realize that I don't really have the right to assume anything about a fictional character behind the counter of a fictional Starbucks in a crappy song, and I certainly don't have the right to speak for African Americans. So let me clear, I'm speaking against white men. They make people like me look bad.

### Postscript

LL Cool J raps this line: "I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood." He does not add "Of course if I had been I would have been **property**" because LL is apparently as stupid as Brad Paisley.
