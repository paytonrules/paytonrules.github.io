# Welcome #

I am a Software Craftsman at 8th Light, helping companies reach their goals through developing custom software.  Currently I am pursuing a Masters Degree in Video Game and Entertainment Technologies at DePaul University, and am working on an iPhone project that I'll be open sourcing very soon.  I've [presented](/speaking.html) at several conferences and user groups on both iPhone and Ruby development, started [chiPhone](http://www.chiphonegroup.org), and have an extensive [github portfolio](http://github.com/paytonrules).  I've [mentored](/mentoring.html) an apprentice as well.

I created this site to highlight my open source projects, including a big iPhone one coming soon, as well as blog about anything that is not really appropriate to my companies blog.
